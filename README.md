### Elevator pitch

Do you dare to try your luck... in binary? The binary mania game is a number-guessing game where you can compete against friends in real time to guess the correct binary number! Be sure to know your counting, because the only hint is whether the number is higher or lower than your guess. Binary mania inspires fun competition, as the scoreboard tracks every win and loss you have against your components. Binary mania will have you thinking in binary in no time.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses 5 HTML pages: sign in, main menu, game session, scoreboard, and settings
- **CSS** - Applying styling that spaces the interactable buttons and text appropriately for different screen sizes
- **React** - Provides sign-in, buttons to input guesses, and toggles in settings
- **Service** - Backend service endpoints for:
    - sign-in
    - retrieving a number
    - submitting guesses
    - submitting scores
    - retrieving scores
    - retrieving settings
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, scores, and settings in the database. Register and sign in users.
- **WebSocket** - When a player in multiplayer wins, the game is stopped for all players and the winner is announced.
